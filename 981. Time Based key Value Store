# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp) 

Explaination : 
Absolutely! You're looking at a class implementation of a Time-based Key-Value Store, also known from the "TimeMap" problem (commonly seen in Leetcode). Let's go through it line by line in simple terms.

🧠 Problem Summary
You need to build a class TimeMap that supports:

set(key, value, timestamp) — Store the key with the given value at the given timestamp.

get(key, timestamp) — Return the value associated with the key at the largest timestamp ≤ given timestamp. If no such timestamp, return an empty string.

🔍 Code Breakdown
1. Constructor
python
Copy code
def __init__(self):
    self.keyStore = {}  # key : list of [val, timestamp]
Initializes an empty dictionary keyStore.

For each key, we store a list of [value, timestamp] pairs, sorted by timestamp automatically since we always append in order.

2. set() Method
python
Copy code
def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
    if key not in self.keyStore:
        self.keyStore[key] = []
    self.keyStore[key].append([value, timestamp])
If the key doesn't exist, initialize it with an empty list.

Append the [value, timestamp] pair to the key's list.

✅ This list will stay sorted by timestamp because timestamps are always given in increasing order.

3. get() Method
python
Copy code
def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
Retrieve the most recent value that was set at or before the given timestamp.

python
Copy code
res, values = "", self.keyStore.get(key, [])
values is the list of [value, timestamp] pairs for the given key. If key doesn’t exist, use empty list.

res is the result to return — initially an empty string.

🔁 Binary Search to Find Closest Timestamp ≤ Given Timestamp
python
Copy code
l, r = 0, len(values) - 1
while l <= r:
    m = (l + r) // 2
    if values[m][1] <= timestamp:
        res = values[m][0]  # possible candidate, but check for better match
        l = m + 1
    else:
        r = m - 1
Standard binary search:

If values[m][1] (current timestamp) is ≤ given timestamp:

It's a valid candidate, but there might be a better (closer) one to the right.

So, move left pointer to m + 1.

If it's too big, move right pointer to m - 1.

This finds the latest value whose timestamp is ≤ the one you asked for.

✅ Return the Result
python
Copy code
return res
res is either the matched value or "" if no valid timestamp was found.

🧪 Example
python
Copy code
obj = TimeMap()
obj.set("foo", "bar", 1)
obj.get("foo", 1)    # Returns "bar"
obj.get("foo", 3)    # Also returns "bar" since 1 <= 3, and no value was set at 2 or 3
✅ Time Complexity
set: O(1) — just an append.

get: O(log n) — binary search over timestamps.
